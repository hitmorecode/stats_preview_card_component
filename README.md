## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge was another good practice for flexbox.

### Continued development

For this challenge I used flexbox, I tried to use grid but, for now I'll stick to flexbox.
The next step is to learn more about grid.
